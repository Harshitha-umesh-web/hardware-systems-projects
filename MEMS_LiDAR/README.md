# MEMS-Based Optical Beam Steering for LiDAR Systems

## Overview
This project explores the application of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) for optical beam steering in LiDAR systems. The work focuses on modeling MEMS-based optical phased arrays to achieve precise beam steering with reduced power consumption and improved system compactness.

The project was completed as part of graduate-level coursework and research, using MATLAB and Lumerical FDTD simulations to analyze beam steering behavior, phase control, and far-field optical performance. The study highlights how MEMS integration can enhance LiDAR capabilities for applications such as autonomous navigation and intelligent sensing.
