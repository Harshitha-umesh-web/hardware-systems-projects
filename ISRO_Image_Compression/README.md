# Hardware-Accelerated Image Compression for Satellite Imaging

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a hardware-accelerated image compression system for satellite imaging applications. The work was carried out as part of an academic research project in collaboration with ISRO and involved implementing the RICE compression algorithm using Verilog and MATLAB.

The objective of the project was to reduce data bandwidth requirements and processing latency for space-based imaging systems, where onboard resources are limited and efficient data handling is critical.

## Technical Contribution
The project involved developing a hardware-oriented compression pipeline capable of performing real-time image compression suitable for satellite payloads. The RICE compression algorithm was selected due to its low computational complexity and suitability for lossless or near-lossless compression in space missions.

Key aspects of the work include:
- Design of a hardware pipeline for image compression using Verilog  
- MATLAB-based verification of compression and reconstruction accuracy  
- Evaluation of compression efficiency and reconstruction fidelity  
- Analysis of suitability for onboard satellite imaging systems

## Results and Impact
The implemented compression architecture successfully demonstrated reduced processing latency while maintaining acceptable reconstruction quality for satellite image data. The results validated the feasibility of hardware-based image compression for space applications, where power efficiency and reliability are critical constraints.

This work contributed to demonstrating how digital hardware acceleration can significantly improve the performance of onboard image processing systems.
